a set of rake tasks that will run tests, commit, pull, re-run tests, and push

sample usage:

when you are ready to check in:

git add .
./ci
Enter your card number:
Enter a description of what you worked on:
Enter your pair name:
(these three values will be persisted for you for future check-ins)

The ci script will then try to pull(and auto merge if possible) run rake test, if it passes your changes will be committed with the details you entered.  The script will then pull again and rerun tests if there were any changes and then push your changes.
